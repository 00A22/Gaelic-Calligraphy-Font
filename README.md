Changing the font of the operating system to Gothic or Gaelic helps tremendously. It makes it much easier to read ancient and medieval texts. The font does not contain characters with macrons and ligatures. For these types of characters you would need to set the compose key. Macrons are not neccessary and the only thing that needs to be changed is the font. Extra letters and ligatures are unnessasry.

It is not neccasarry to install unicode. You only need to change the font on the computer. I did change the "R" to "R" and the "S" to ""êž‚ I personally feel it is a bit feel a bit more refined. From what I understand, it was used in Latin, middle Irish, and middle English.

I could never get Ubuntu to work properly. Ubuntu has a hard time rendering the fonts correctly in the web browser. Fedora was a much easier experience. Just add the font file into the Font Manager, then change each font to "my font" in the Font settings page.
